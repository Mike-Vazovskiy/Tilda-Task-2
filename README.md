# Tilda-Task-2
That's how I completed the test task for Tilda Publishing
----------------------
I made one main product card. Also, I decided to make 
a mini-card for the product catalog.

Known bugs:

1) You can add one item to the cart even if 
the number of items is zero
2) Buttons "Buy" and "Add to cart" have the same functionality
3) You tell me :)
